## Getting started
First, copy the `.env` file into `.env.local` and fill in the necessary environment variables.

Then, install the dependencies:

```sh
cd the-folder-with-your-project
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To re-run the code generation (e.g. after changing the Prisma schema), run:

```sh
npm run codegen
```

You can also access the Prisma CLI:

```sh
npm run prisma -- <args-to-prisma-command>
```
